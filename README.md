## 🧠 My Approach

1. **Content Planning:** I listed the important sections employers look for — About, Skills, Projects, Experience, and Contact.
2. **Design Focus:** I created a clean, modern layout with minimal distractions and clear navigation.
3. **Responsiveness:** The design adapts to mobile and desktop screens using flexible CSS.
4. **Interactivity:** JavaScript powers form submissions and prepares the site for future enhancements.
5. **Version Control:** I used GitHub to keep the code versioned and organized.
